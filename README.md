# Accelerated Stein Variational Gradient Flows

These python scripts evaluate and plot the discretized accelerated Stein variational gradient flow (with Wasserstein-2 regularization) as described in the preprint [TODO].

The file targets.py contains a custom class ```target```, which specifies the target distribution (its density, score, normalization constant...) and allows you to define your own target distributions.
Auxiliary functions are collected in plotting.py, adds.py.
